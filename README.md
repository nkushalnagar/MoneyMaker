# Trend Comparing

The purpose of this project is to compare the popularity of two topics and return which topic has been more popular. The tool uses Search API which retrieves Google data and is intended for use in the past week in the United States.

# How it works

Using this tool is simple, you simply enter two topics you want to compare and the popularity of each will be indexed from 1-100, ultimately returning the prevailing topic.
